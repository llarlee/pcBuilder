PCBuilder code test
The purpose of this microservice is to provide a simulation of getting hardware data to build a computer system. This microservice is the back-end which would be called by a separate UI requesting motherboard, CPU, and RAM options that could be chosen. It uses an in-memory database (H2) populated upon startup to hold the data and provides endpoints for the various requests.
